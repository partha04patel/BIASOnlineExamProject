# BIASOnlineExamProject
 The Java exam application a built this past summer during my internship. The program is connected to a mySQL database that contains all the possible questions and answers, as well as the usernames and passwords of users through a JDBC connector. This provides a method of user authentication so that the user's attempts and scores can be tracked each time the user takes an exam. Depending on the role, the difficulty of the exam may be higher or lower, so candidates for entry level jobs would get more easy-level with some medium-level questions. The program stores the user's answers when the the user submits the exam , as well as the time the exam started and was finished, and the score and time taken is displayed to the user at the end of the exam. When an admin logs in, the admin can view candidates' attempts, their scores, and the time taken for each exam.
